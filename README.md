# First-Formik-Form
## Description:
My first form app. The user is prompted to submit their email address and password in the input box. This project is built on the React app and utilizes jsx syntax as well as the Formik library.
## How to Run:
1. Fork the repository in its entirety into your account.
2. clone the repository to your machine.
3. Run the command **cd path/to/project/root**, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files).
4. Within the same command-line window, run **npm install** to install all dependencies.
5. Once the command completes successfully, run **npm start** to start the application in your browser.
6. Experiment with different inputs and interact with the 'submit' button.
7. To end application, hit ^c.
## Roadmap of future improvements:
In the next iterations of the program, we will add a home page after the user successfully logs in.
